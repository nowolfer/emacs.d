# A reasonable Emacs config

This is my emacs configuration tree, base on [purcell](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git)
It works on OS X, Linux not sure about Windows(Try it out!)

Emacs itself comes with support for many programming languages. Here i add some as following:

* CSS / LESS / SASS /SCSS
* Javascript / Coffeescript
* Python
* Elm
* Common Lisp (with Slime)

In particular, there's a nice config for *tab autocompletion*, and
`flycheck` is used to immediately highlight syntax errors in Ruby, HAML,
Python, Javascript, PHP and a number of other languages.

## Supported Emacs versions

The config should run on Emacs 23.3 or greater and is designed to
degrade smoothly - see the Travis build - but note that Emacs 24 and
above is required for an increasing number of key packages, including
`magit` and `flycheck`, so to get full you should use the latest Emacs
version available to you.

## Other requirements

To make the most of the programming language-specific support in this
config, further programs will likely be required, particularly those
that [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) uses to provide
on-the-fly syntax checking.

## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```
git clone https://github.com/nowolfer/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you
encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly
running `M-x package-refresh-contents` before doing so.

## Updates

Update the config with `git pull`. You'll probably also want/need to update
the third-party packages regularly too:

<kbd>M-x package-list-packages</kbd>, then <kbd>U</kbd> followed by <kbd>x</kbd>.

## Adding your own customization

To add your own customization, use <kbd>M-x customize</kbd> and/or
create a file `~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el` which looks like this:

```el
... your code here ...

(provide 'init-local)
```

If you need initialisation code which executes earlier in the startup process,
you can also create an `~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-preload-local.el` file.

If you plan to customize things more extensively, you should probably
just fork the repo and hack away at the config to make it your own!

## Similar configs

You might also want to check out `emacs-starter-kit` and `prelude`.

## Support / issues

If you hit any problems, please first ensure that you are using the latest version
of this code, and that you have updated your packages to the most recent available
versions (see "Updates" above). If you still experience problems, go ahead and
[file an issue on the github project](https://github.com/nowolfer/emacs.d).
